Use aggregate function to complete various analyses of the test results.

```{r}
library(plyr)
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)
#Import PcResults_TestResults csv for the classifier
agg_data <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\Yvonne\\OneDrive\\PHD\\CHP1-FKW\\data\\results\\2018\\20180824_PMN_100x/PcResults_TestResults_PMN_20180824.csv')


#1. How many times was each acoustic encounter represented in the test data?
AcEncs_Test <- aggregate(x = agg_data, 
                               by = list(unique.values = agg_data$EncounterID), 
                               FUN = length)
#Same result as using 'aggregate'
count(agg_data$EncounterID)

#2. How many times were the populations classified correctly using a threshold of >=50%?
count(agg_data$EncounterClass)
# 1 Ambiguous  222
# 2       MHI   58
# 3      NWHI    8
# 4   Pelagic   12

#Get frequencies for every value and every variable in df
lapply(agg_data, count)


### THIS WORKS!! ####
#Loop the subsetting to sum up things 
IDs <- unique(agg_data$EncounterID)
filtByEnc = NULL
filtCorrect = NULL
for (k in 1:length(IDs)){
  temp <- agg_data[agg_data$EncounterID==IDs[k], ]
  correct <- data.frame("EncounterID" = IDs[k], "x"=sum(temp$Pct.Correct >= 50)) 
  filtCorrect = rbind(filtCorrect, correct)
  filtByEnc = rbind(filtByEnc, temp)
}
filtCorrect$EncounterID <-as.character(filtCorrect$EncounterID) 

filtCorrect <- filtCorrect[order(as.character(filtCorrect$EncounterID)),]

#What is the number of correctly classified encounters based on the number of times the acoustic encounter was included in the test data?
#Combine filtered correct data with tally of times ac enc was included in the test data
agg_data_sum <- cbind(filtCorrect, "y" = AcEncs_Test$X)

#Divide columns to get proportional data and add that into a third column
library(dplyr)
agg_data_sum <- mutate(agg_data_sum, new = x/y)


write.csv(agg_data_sum,'C:\\Users\\Yvonne\\OneDrive\\PHD\\CHP1-FKW\\data\\results\\2018\\PcResults_AggregatedTestResults_20180830.csv', row.names = F )

#If needed
#Get frequencies for every value and every variable in df
lapply(agg_data, count)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
